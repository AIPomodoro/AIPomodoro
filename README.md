# Introduction

## Overview
- The AI Pomodoro Timer is a web application that uses the Pomodoro Technique to help users manage their time and work more efficiently. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. The AI Pomodoro Timer will use machine learning to predict the optimal work and break times for the user based on their work habits and the time of day. This will be achieved through a sentiment analysis model. The application will also provide the user with a variety of tools to help them stay focused and motivated during work sessions, such as a to-do list, a progress tracker, and a journal to log how they are feeling after their session. The AI Pomodoro Timer will be accessible through a web browser and will be available for free to all users.

## Motivation
- As users of the Pomodoro Technique ourselves, we have found that it is a very effective way to manage our time and stay focused during work sessions. However, we have also found that it can be difficult to determine the optimal work and break times for ourselves, and that it can be hard to stay motivated and focused during work sessions. We believe that by using machine learning to predict the optimal work and break times for the user, and by providing them with a variety of tools to help them stay focused and motivated, we can create a more effective and user-friendly Pomodoro Timer that will help users manage their time and work more efficiently.

## Project in context of the market
- There are many Pomodoro Timers available on the market, both as web applications and mobile applications. However, we have yet to find one that uses machine learning to adjust the work and break times for the user based on their feedback and how they are feeling. We believe this makes it unique and will help it stand out in the market.

# Customer Value

## Customer Need
- The primary customer we are targetting is anyone who is looking to manage their time and work more efficiently. This could include students, professionals, or anyone else who is looking to stay focused and motivated during work sessions. We believe that the AI Pomodoro Timer will be especially useful for people who are new to the Pomodoro Technique and are looking for a good way to be more productive with their time management. The customer wants to be able to manage their time and work more efficiently, and to stay focused and motivated during work sessions.

## Proposed Solution
- We will use sentiment analysis, a natural language processing technique, to predict the optimal work and break times for the user based on their feedback and how they are feeling via input into their journal. We will also provide the user with a variety of tools to help them stay focused and motivated during work sessions, such as a to-do list, a progress tracker, and a journal to log how they are feeling after their session. The AI Pomodoro Timer will be first available through a web browser.
- A consumer would benefit from using our AI Pomodoro Timer because they will be able to manage their time more efficiently and stay focused/motivated during work sessions. Our application enables the user to have an entirely different experience from other Pomodoro timers because we are automatically adjusting their intervals based on their results, improving their experience as a whole.

## Measures of Success
- The AI Pomodoro Timer will be considered successful if it is able to accurately predict and create optimal work/break times for the user. We will measure the success of our AI Pomodoro Timer by tracking the number of users who sign up for the application, the number of users who use the application on a regular basis, and the number of users who provide positive feedback about the application.
- We want to enable our users to be more productive as a number one priority. If we can achieve this goal, we will consider our application a success.
