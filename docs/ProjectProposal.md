# Introduction

## Overview
- The AI Pomodoro Timer is a web application that uses the Pomodoro Technique to help users manage their time and work more efficiently. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. The AI Pomodoro Timer will use machine learning to predict the optimal work and break interval durations for the user based on their work habits and the time of day. This will be achieved through a sentiment analysis model and feedback data from the user. The application will also provide the user with a variety of tools to help them stay focused and motivated during work/study sessions, such as a to-do list, a progress tracker, and a journal to log how they are feeling after their session. The AI Pomodoro Timer will be accessible through a web browser and will be available for free to all users.

## Motivation
- As users of the Pomodoro Technique ourselves, we have found that it is a very effective way to manage our time and stay focused during long work sessions. However, we have also found that it can be difficult to determine the optimal work and break times for ourselves, which can make it hard to stay motivated and focused during work sessions. Additionally, we have found that different time intervals are more or less optimal for different tasks. We believe that by using machine learning to predict the optimal work and break times for the user, and by providing them with a variety of tools to help them stay focused and motivated, we can create a more effective and user-friendly Pomodoro Timer that will help users manage their time and work more efficiently.

## Project in context of the market
- There are many Pomodoro Timers available on the market, both as web applications and mobile applications. However, existing products typically consist of just a basic timer, which the user must manually set, and lack many other useful features. We have yet to find an existing application that uses machine learning to optimally adjust the work and break times for the user based on their feedback and how they are feeling. We believe this approach makes it unique and will help it stand out in the market. Our application enables the user to have an entirely different experience from other existing products because we are automatically adjusting their intervals based on their results, improving the user experience as a whole.

# Customer Value

## Customer Need
- The primary customer we are targetting is anyone who is looking to manage their time and work more efficiently. This could include students, professionals, or anyone else who is looking for a way to stay focused and motivated during work or study sessions. We believe that the AI Pomodoro Timer will be especially useful for people who are new to the Pomodoro Technique and are still learning to use it effectively.

## Proposed Solution
- We will use sentiment analysis, a natural language processing technique, to predict the optimal work and break times for the user based on their feedback and how they are feeling via input into their journal. We will also provide the user with a variety of additional tools to help them stay focused and motivated during work sessions, such as a to-do list, a progress tracker, and a journal to log how they are feeling after their session. The AI Pomodoro Timer will be first available through a web browser.
- A consumer would benefit from using our AI Pomodoro Timer because they will be able to manage their time more efficiently and stay focused/motivated during work sessions.

## Measures of Success
- The AI Pomodoro Timer will be considered successful if it is able to accurately predict and create optimal work/break times for the user. We will measure the success of our AI Pomodoro Timer by a number of metrics including the number of users who create an account, the number of users who frequently use the application, and the number of users who provide positive feedback about the application. We will also measure the efficacy of our app based on user engagement time and the overall quality of their work sessions.
- Our primary goal is to provide a tool that enables our users to be more productive. If we can achieve this goal, we will consider our application a success.

## Technology
We plan on implementing our solution using the full-stack web framework, RedwoodJS. Redwood is based on React with a number of pre-installed packages and added features. We expect this will simplify and speed up development.
The model will be implemented with Pytorch and integrated into the backend of the application.

## Team
Roles will rotate throughout the semester based on sprint planning.
### Daniel Mallett
#### Previous Experience:
 - Web Development experience with C#/.NET, React, and Angular
 - Undergraduate research on neuromorphic computing
#### Role: Frontend Development

### Braden Hechmer

#### Previous Experience:
- Creating webapps using ML
- Undergraduate research on neuromorphic computing

#### Role: Backend Development 

## Project Management
### Schedule:
We foresee being able to complete and deploy a minimally viable product by the end of the semester.
In-person team meetings will be scheduled weekly where we will discuss sprint planning and track progess. Remote meetings (via Discord) will be scheduled as needed.   
### Constraints
The user data that will be collected will be minimal and we will provide complete transparancy and disclosure for the user. We are not anticipating any regulatory or legal constraints at this time.
### Resources
All of our data will be directly collected within our applictaion or come from open source sentiment analysis data sets.
### Descoping
In the event that we are not able to access necessary data, our product will certainly be less effective but will still provide all the core functionality of an ordinary pomodoro timer. It will continue to function and be useful.
